    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly
      recognized Filipino foods. Not to be mistaken with Mexican adobo, this
      dish is uniquely prepared by stewing chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several sources who are experts in Asian food history say that the
      Filipinos were already cooking adobo even before Spanish colonization.
      According to them, cooking with vinegar preserves the meat. This method is
      also considered as one of the earliest food preservation practice.
